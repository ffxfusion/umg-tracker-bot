# umg-tracker-bot
private tracker bot for UMG, can track specific username, globals and more (still in development)

setting up is not very user friendly so ill try and expain some things.
but ill make a video on it some day

userbot -> proxy server -> tracker bot

uses a userbot to read the embeds and posts it in a server and then tracker bot reads from that server and handles it
youll have to change the id's in the code and setup a database for it to run.


NOTE:
shit here is not easy to setup, if you want to setup for yourself then contact me via the umg discord.
i will probally make a tool that sets it up automatically for your needs

for now contact:

ssyaro or s.yaro (prefered)
